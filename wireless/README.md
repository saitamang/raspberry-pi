Basically what I am doing is by reading the frequency transmitted by another transmitter from my pi.

1. Install the frequency reader into your machine

`http://gqrx.dk/`
# this is for linux

2. Connect the RTL-SDR to your linux machine

3. Run the GQRX tools and set your frequency to read
# Noted that the frequency is in KHz instead of MHz
